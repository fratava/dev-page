# Introduction

The radio spectra of main-sequence stars remain largely unconstrained due to the lack of observational data to inform stellar atmosphere models. As such, the dominant emission mechanisms at long wavelengths, how they vary with spectral type, and how much they contribute to the expected brightness at a given radio wavelength are still relatively unknown for most spectral types. 
The particular characteristics of the emission at millimeter, submillimeter, and infrared wavelengths in the solar chromosphere allow us to estimate their temperature and density using
indirect methodologies like semiempirical models (Vernazza
et al. 1981; Fontenla et al. 1993; Avrett & Loeser 2008). These
models are an important tool for a wide set of studies, e.g.,
solar and stellar chromospheres (Loukitcheva et al. 2004;
Linsky 2017), temperature minimum (Liseau et al. 2013; De la
Luz et al. 2014), solar flares (Machado et al. 1980; Trottet et al.
2015), and Sun component features (Fontenla et al. 2006).

Semiempirical models predict values close to photospheric temperatures
that decrease until a minimum, then increase dramatically until
the coronae (Vernazza et al. 1981; Avrett & Loeser 2008).

This layer is known as the solar
chromosphere. The chromosphere remains observable by
different spectral ranges that include ultraviolet in the
continuum and line emission, in the visible (mainly Hα), and
in the millimeter, submillimeter, and infrared wavelengths.
This last wavelength range becomes more important as
improvements in the sensitivity and space resolution in modern
radio telescopes are made (Nakajima et al. 1995; Kudaka et al.
2015; Wedemeyer et al. 2016).

We present radio continuum observations of Altair, a rapidly rotating A-type star. We observed Altair with NOEMA in 2018 and 2019 at 1.34, 2.09, and 3.22 mm and with the Very Large Array in 2019 at 6.7 and 9.1 mm. In the radio spectra, we see a brightness temperature minimum at millimeter wavelengths followed by a steep rise to temperatures larger than the optical photosphere, behavior that is unexpected for A-type stars. We use these data to produce the first submillimeter to centimeter spectrum of a rapidly rotating A-type star informed by observations. We generated both PHOENIX and KINICH-PAKAL model atmospheres and determine the KINICH-PAKAL model better reproduces Altair's radio spectrum. The synthetic spectrum shows a millimeter brightness temperature minimum followed by significant emission over that of the photosphere at centimeter wavelengths. Together, these data and models show how the radio spectrum of an A-type star can reveal the presence of a chromosphere, likely induced by rapid rotation, and that a Rayleigh Jean's extrapolation of the stellar photosphere is not an adequate representation of a star's radio spectrum.

The nearest stellar system to the Sun, αCentauri, is located at a
distance of 1.3 pc (π = 747.1 ± 1.2 mas, Söderhjelm 1999). The
physical binary is composed of two solar-like stars, the brighter
of which, αCen A (HIP 71683, HD 128620) a G2 V star, is often considered a “solar twin” (Cayrel de Strobel 1996; Meléndez
et al. 2009). The companion, αCen B, is of slightly later spectral type (K1) and has recently been found to host an Earth-mass
planet (Dumusque et al. 2012). A possible link between chemical composition in the atmospheres of solar twins and the formation of systems containing rocky planets has been proposed
by Meléndez et al. (2009).
No planet has yet been found around the primary, however,
but like the Sun, αCen A shows evidence of chromospheric
emission in the optical and ultraviolet spectral regions (Ayres
et al. 1976; Judge et al. 2004, and references therein) and should
therefore also have atmospheric regions where the temperature
gradient turns from negative to positive. There, the radial temperature profile of the star should exhibit a minimum. The rise
in temperature beyond the “minimum temperature” region is
caused by non-radiative energy being deposited, which leads
to the heating of the higher atmospheric levels. The responsible physical processes are as yet unidentified and constitute the
subject of intense study in solar physics and stellar astrophysics
(Kalkofen 2007; Wedemeyer-Böhm et al. 2012; Cohen et al.
2005; Harper et al. 2013).
The minimum temperature of the solar atmosphere can only
be measured directly in the far infrared (FIR; Eddy et al. 1969;
Avrett 2003). In the wavelength region ∼50−350 µm, the atmosphere becomes optically thick owing to the dominating H−
freefree opacity (∝λ
2
; Geltman 1965; Doughty & Fraser 1966) and,
consequently, radiates at lower temperatures than the layers beneath (the photosphere in the visible, where τ0.5 µm > 1). 


The precise location of the temperature minimum depends on the detailed structure of the atmosphere and can, with no convincing theory at hand, only be determined from direct measurement. It is in this region where non-radiative energy is deposited, and its physics is of strong general interest.
By analogy, this phenomenon can also be expected on αCen A. We therefore set out to obtain such data with the Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010) in the FIR and complementary ones with the ground-based APEX submillimetre (submm) telescope. These facilities allow photometric imaging observations with high sensitivity. We present our findings in this Letter, which is organised as follows. In Sect. 2, the observations and reduction of the data are briefly described. The results are presented and discussed in Sect. 3, and in Sect. 4, our main conclusions are summarised.
