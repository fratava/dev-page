# Introduction

The radio spectra of main-sequence stars remain largely unconstrained due to the lack of observational data to inform stellar atmosphere models. As such, the dominant emission mechanisms at long wavelengths, how they vary with spectral type, and how much they contribute to the expected brightness at a given radio wavelength are still relatively unknown for most spectral types. 
The particular characteristics of the emission at millimeter, submillimeter, and infrared wavelengths in the solar chromosphere allow us to estimate their temperature and density using
indirect methodologies like semiempirical models (Vernazza et al. 1981; Fontenla et al. 1993; Avrett & Loeser 2008). These models are an important tool for a wide set of studies, e.g., solar and stellar chromospheres (Loukitcheva et al. 2004;Linsky 2017), temperature minimum (Liseau et al. 2013; De la Luz et al. 2014), solar flares (Machado et al. 1980; Trottet et al.
2015), and Sun component features (Fontenla et al. 2006).

Semiempirical models predict values close to photospheric temperatures that decrease until a minimum, then increase dramatically until the coronae (Vernazza et al. 1981; Avrett & Loeser 2008). This layer is known as the solar chromosphere. The chromosphere remains observable by different spectral ranges that include ultraviolet in the continuum and line emission, in the visible (mainly Hα), and in the millimeter, submillimeter, and infrared wavelengths.
This last wavelength range becomes more important as improvements in the sensitivity and space resolution in modern radio telescopes are made (Nakajima et al. 1995; Kudaka et al. 2015; Wedemeyer et al. 2016).

In this work, we present a new relation between temperature minimum and effective temperaature of the star. We use the models obtained with KINICH PAKAL (Tapia-vázquez & De la Luz, 2020) to construct a grid of semiempirical models. Addicionally, we construct a grid of observed brightness temperature.

We present radio continuum observations of Altair, a rapidly rotating A-type star. We observed Altair with NOEMA in 2018 and 2019 at 1.34, 2.09, and 3.22 mm and with the Very Large Array in 2019 at 6.7 and 9.1 mm. In the radio spectra, we see a brightness temperature minimum at millimeter wavelengths followed by a steep rise to temperatures larger than the optical photosphere, behavior that is unexpected for A-type stars. We use these data to produce the first submillimeter to centimeter spectrum of a rapidly rotating A-type star informed by observations. We generated both PHOENIX and KINICH-PAKAL model atmospheres and determine the KINICH-PAKAL model better reproduces Altair's radio spectrum. The synthetic spectrum shows a millimeter brightness temperature minimum followed by significant emission over that of the photosphere at centimeter wavelengths. Together, these data and models show how the radio spectrum of an A-type star can reveal the presence of a chromosphere, likely induced by rapid rotation, and that a Rayleigh Jean's extrapolation of the stellar photosphere is not an adequate representation of a star's radio spectrum.

# Methods

Our work is based in previous models of main sequence stars obtained from FIR to mm wavelenghts observations  (White et al. 2021; White et al. 2020; Tapia-Vázquez &  De la luz, 2020).

## Observations

Observations at frequencies greater than 1000 GHz were obtained from Herschel data archival. Beetween 1000 GHz and 90 GHz observations came from ALMA and NOEMA. For low frequencies like 33 GHz and 17 GHz, observations were performand with VLA and ATCA. 

In literature we can  (Villadsen et al. 2014, Liseau et al. 2016, White et al. 2018, Rodríguez et al. 2019, White et al. 2020, White et al. 2021)
